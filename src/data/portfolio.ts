  intro: `I'm Zhenkai Zhang (Ken), an incoming Data Science student at PolyU with a background in mathematical modeling, machine learning, and AI system development.

My undergraduate work spans research-oriented machine learning and industry-oriented AI development. I have authored a first-author JCR Q2 SCI paper on Olympic medal prediction, contributed as the second student author to a JCR Q2 SCI paper on mechanical behavior prediction for thin-walled steel–ply–bamboo structures, and completed a first-author conference review on advanced MoE architectures from DeepSpeed-MoE to DeepSeek-V3. I also received the MCM/ICM Meritorious Winner award and maintained a GPA of 3.94/4.0.

On the engineering side, I participated in the development of the EnergyQuant investment platform, independently built a Finance Agent system for analyzing 4,000+ stocks, and launched two mini programs using Codex.

My current interests lie in efficient generative AI, multimodal foundation models, and agentic AI systems. I am seeking research assistantship opportunities where I can contribute to experiments, benchmarking, system prototyping, and paper writing.`,
