  intro: `I'm Zhenkai Zhang (Ken), an incoming Data Science student at PolyU with a background in mathematical modeling, machine learning, and AI system development.

My undergraduate work spans research-oriented machine learning and industry-oriented AI development. My publication record includes a first-author AINIT 2025 paper on advanced MoE architectures, a first-author Applied Sciences paper on Olympic medal prediction, a third-author Sustainability paper on thin-walled steel-ply-bamboo structural behavior prediction, a second-author robotic vision review, and a third-author DEIC 2025 paper on digital service trade. I also received the MCM Meritorious Winner award and maintained a GPA of 88/100.

On the engineering side, I participated in the development of the EnergyQuant investment platform, independently built a Finance Agent system for analyzing 4,000+ stocks, and launched two mini programs using Codex.

My current interests lie in efficient generative AI, Mixture-of-Experts, model adaptation and reuse, and agentic AI systems. I am seeking research assistantship opportunities where I can contribute to experiments, benchmarking, system prototyping, and paper writing.`,
