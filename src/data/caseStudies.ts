      "This study explores the application and optimization of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models in large-scale language models. We analyze the fundamental principles and limitations of the MoE architecture, followed by an in-depth examination of optimization strategies in advanced MoE architectures, including Switch Transformer, Deepspeed-MoE, PR-MoE, Mixtral 8x7B, Glam, DBRX and DeepSeek-V3. Through comprehensive benchmarks across five dimensions (popular aggregated results, commonsense reasoning, world knowledge, code and math), we compare these MoE models against the LLaMA family, Qwen 2.5 72B Base, GPT family and Claude family. Our findings indicate that MoE is a model architecture capable of maintaining high performance even under computational constraints. Techniques such as pyramid structures with residual connections, sparse activation, adaptive adjustment of expert numbers and sizes and shared expert isolation contribute to performance enhancement. Compared to standard Transformer models, MoE can achieve at least a 50% reduction in inference computation while preserving model performance. Furthermore, MoE achieves higher benchmark scores in mathematical and coding tasks. Open-source MoE models, exemplified by DeepSeek-V3, democratize AI research by lowering barriers to entry and fostering global collaboration. Community-driven initiatives, such as standardized simulation-to-real transfer protocols and resource-sharing platforms, address key challenges.",

    abstract:
      "This study develops two machine learning models to predict the medal performance of countries at the 2028 Olympic Games while systematically analyzing and quantifying the impacts of the host effect and exceptional coaching on medal gains. The dataset encompasses records of total medals by country, event categories, and athletes’ participation from the Olympic Games held between 1896 and 2024. We use K-means clustering to analyze medal trends, categorizing 234 nations into four groups (α1, α2, α3, α4). Among these, α1, α2, α3 represent medal-winning countries, while α4 consists of non-medal-winning nations. For the α1, α2, and α3 groups, 2–3 representative countries from each are selected for trend analysis, with the United States serving as a case study. This study extracts ten factors that may influence medal wins from the dataset, including participant data, the number of events, and medal growth rates. Factor analysis is used to reduce them into three principal components: Factor analysis condenses ten influencing factors into three principal components: the event scale factor (F1), the medal trend factor (F2), and the gender and athletic ability factor (F3). An ARIMA model predicts the factor coefficients for 2028 as 0.9539, 0.7999, and 0.2937, respectively. Four models (random forest, BP Neural Network, XGBoost, and SVM) are employed to predict medal outcomes, using historical data split into training and testing sets to compare their predictive performance. The research results show that XGBoost is the optimal medal predicted model, with the United States projected to win 57 gold medals and a total of 135 medals in 2028. For non-medal-winning countries (α4), a three-layer fully connected neural network (FCNN) is constructed, achieving an accuracy of 85.5% during testing. Additionally, a formula to calculate the host effect and a Bayesian linear regression model to assess the impact of exceptional coaching on athletes’ medal performance are proposed. The overall trend of countries in the α1 group is stable, but they are significantly affected by the host effect; the trend in the α2 group shows an upward trend; the trend in the α3 group depend on the athletes’ conditions and whether the events they excel in are included in that year’s Olympics. In the α4 group, the probabilities of the United Arab Republic (UAR) and Mali (MLI) winning medals in the 2028 Olympic Games are 77.47% and 58.47%, respectively, and there are another four countries with probabilities exceeding 30%. For the eight most recent Olympic Games, the gain rate of the host effect is 74%. Great coaches can bring an average increase of 0.2 to 0.5 medals for each athlete. The proposed models, through an innovative integration of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and predictive algorithms, provide reliable forecasts and data-driven insights for optimizing national sports strategies. These contributions not only address the gap in predicting first-time medal wins for non-medal-winning nations but also offer guidance for policymakers and sports organizations, though they are constrained by assumptions of stable historical trends, minimal external disruptions, and the exclusion of unknown athletes.",

      "This study employed multiple machine learning and hyperparameter optimization techniques to analyze and predict the mechanical properties of self-drilling screw connections in thin-walled steel–ply–bamboo shear walls, leveraging the renewable and eco-friendly nature of bamboo to enhance structural sustainability and reduce environmental impact. The dataset, which included 249 sets of measurement data, was derived from 51 disparate connection specimens fabricated with engineered bamboo—a renewable and low-carbon construction material. Utilizing factor analysis, a ranking table recording the comprehensive score of each connection specimen was established to select the optimal connection type. Eight machine learning models were employed to analyze and predict the mechanical performance of these connection specimens. Through comparison, the most efficient model was selected, and five hyperparameter optimization algorithms were implemented to further enhance its prediction accuracy. The analysis results revealed that the Random Forest (RF) model demonstrated superior classification performance, prediction accuracy, and generalization ability, achieving approximately 61% accuracy on the test set (the highest among all models). In hyperparameter optimization, the RF model processed through Bayesian Optimization (BO) further improved its predictive accuracy to about 67%, outperforming both its non-optimized version and models optimized using the other algorithms. Considering the mechanical performance of connections within TWS composite structures, applying the BO algorithm to the RF model significantly improved the predictive accuracy. This approach enables the identification of the most suitable specimen type based on newly provided mechanical performance parameter sets, providing a data-driven pathway for sustainable bamboo–steel composite structure design.",

    abstract:
      "This study explores the impact of the development level of the digital economy in countries along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on the export potential of digital service trade. A stochastic frontier gravity model (SFGM) is employed to analyze the bilateral trade efficiency of 36 countries. The results show that digital economy development in exporting countries significantly enhances their potential in digital service exports. Furthermore, the share of service value-added in GDP and the Digital Technology Index play mediating roles in this relationship, indicating the transmission mechanisms through which digitalization boosts trade performance. Geographical distance continues to exert a negative impact on digital service trade. Additionally, this study introduces a machine learning-based forecasting framework by integrating the XGBoost algorithm with Genetic Algorithm optimization. This approach accurately predicts the trajectories of key variables, such as the Digital Economy Index and Trade Openness, enhancing the robustness of export potential estimation and providing forward-looking policy insights. The findings offer both theoretical and practical implications for enhancing digital infrastructure, improving trade facilitation, and fostering regional digital economic integration under the BRI framework.",
